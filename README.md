# NFL_defenses
Less of a coding project and more of a writing one. I just use R's powerful dplyr library to query the stats I want to see so I can give commentary on some of the best defenses the NFL ever had and also categorize them by certain aspects of  a defense.  Special thanks to The Football Databases for the data.

Update 5/4/22: Now comes with Tableau graphs!

Update 5/22/22: Unfortunately since GitHub doesn't translate html files well at all (or at least just my file), I'll upload a pdf version instead which looks less aesthetically than the html version... when it works. Message me for the html version.
