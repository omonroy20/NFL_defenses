# NFL_defenses
Less of a coding project and more of a writing one. I just use R's powerful dplyr library to query the stats I want to see so I can give commentary on some of the best defenses the NFL ever had and also categorize them by certain aspects of  a defense.  Special thanks to The Football Databases for the data.

Update 5/4/21: Now comes with Tableau graphs!
